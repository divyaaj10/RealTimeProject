1.Customer Churn Prediction App

   This is a real-time Customer Churn Prediction Web App built using Streamlit and a pre-trained Machine Learning model (churn_model.pkl). The app predicts whether a       customer is likely to churn (leave the service) based on their profile and usage data.

2.Features

  - User-friendly Streamlit web interface.

  - Takes customer information as input (e.g., age, tenure, monthly charges, etc.).

  - Predicts Churn Probability in real-time.

  - Displays prediction results with a clear "Will Churn" / "Will Not Churn" output.

  - Deployable locally or on the cloud (Streamlit Cloud)

3. Tech Stack

  - Python 

  - Streamlit (Frontend + Deployment)

  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning model training)

  - Pandas, NumPy (Data processing)

  - Pickle (Model serialization â€“ churn_model.pkl)
